# 🔐 Password Saver

Password Saver is a simple and secure desktop application built using JavaFX that allows you to store your passwords locally — without relying on cloud storage or internet access. It’s designed for users who prefer privacy, control, and ease of use when managing their sensitive information.

## 💡 Why Password Saver?

Most password managers today store your data on big servers, which can be targeted by hackers. With Password Saver, your data is stored **only on your computer**, which makes it much harder for anyone else to access it — unless they already have access to your device. It's a great option for everyday users and even those who aren't very tech-savvy, like grandparents, who might not trust cloud services.

Our goal was to create a **user-friendly, offline** solution that still uses strong encryption to keep your data safe — and that’s exactly what this app delivers.
